Welcome to my website. My name is Jonas Peter and I started my career as an apprentice in the Sappi Mill in Alfeld. I continued my work at the Koehler Paper Group and finished my bachelors degree in paper technology. My thesis was carried out in the R&D-Department of the Koehler Mill in Oberkirch. It's main objective was to investige the influence of diffrent factors on the precoat of a thermal paper. 

I am currently trying to deepen my knowledge even further in the field of speciality papers. That's why I just started my first semester of the consecutive master at the HM.
